REUZE is an environmentally friendly mobile app. 
Its goal is to help users locate resources whose materials they can use to design amazing upcycled works and art. 
Additionally, the app helps to reduce environmental impacts.

The mobile app was designed with User Centered Design principles baked in to ensure that I empathized and understood users expressed and latent needs. 
User Journeys, surveys and interviews were used to accomplish this goal.

Design Thinking is infused into the design process to ensure the mobile app works effectively. 
Mobile design patterns, gesture optimization, wireframes, prototypes and field testing were implemented to ensure the goal was achieved.
